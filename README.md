N64 Gamepad Viewer Skin


This Repository contains a Skin for the Gamepad Viewer
Its a classical N64 Skin.

Credits for the .css File go to VideGameRoulette (GitHub User, createt Tron skin)
I copied the code, changed the Skin and made a new Mapping

This Mapping works for the Mayflash Adapter with an miadore Retro 64-Bit N64 Controller
Except the D-Pad doesnt Work, because of some Issues with the N64 Controller in general


Just copy the following link into your OBS to make dreams come true:
